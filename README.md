## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sridhar Ranganathan (Sri). I am currently the Director of Bioinformatics at Jumpcode Genomics. Thanks for visiting my GitHub and feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I am currently interested in solving problems in genomics. Of late, I have spoiled myself in genome-editing, using CRISPRs in applications outside cells and analysis of NGS datasets.
