## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sridhar Ranganathan (Sri). I am currently the Director of Bioinformatics at Jumpcode Genomics. Thanks for visiting my GitHub. I am currently interested in solving problems in genomics using computational approaches. 

Lately, I have been fascinated by the use of CRISPR enzymes outside of a cell for purposes that do not concern genome-editing. e.g. Can CRISPRs be used to enrich the quality of the data from next-generation sequencing experiments?
